Everything above this line is the header.


<!-- The following text won't be displayed in your document.  It tells R how to make nicer looking buttons for your tabbed content. -->

<style type="text/css" rel="stylesheet">

Use this document as a template to build your final project.

If you've already created the file index.Rmd in your docs folder, you can paste everything below the header into that document.

If you don't yet have an index.Rmd file, save this document as index.Rmd in the docs folder of your main class folder.

Edit this template to fill in your own content.

# Functions 1: Data Structure Functions {.tabset .tabset-pills}

Look at the source code for the final project template, you'll notice the text:

{.tabset .tabset-pills}

This creates tabbed content for all the following sections that are one-level below.

- If you include them on a primary header (one #), all of the subsequent secondary headers will in tabs.




## `c()`

The following is the markdown text needed to reproduce my code example for `c()`:


The function `c()` *combines* or *concatenates* its arguments into a vector (a 1-dimensional data structure consisting of 1 or more elements).

- All of the elements must be of the same *type*.
  - I can't combine character and numeric types in the same call to `c()`

Here's two examples using numeric and character data types:

```{r}
# Create a vector of numbers:
num_vec  = c(1, 4, 8, 9, 13)

# Create a vector of characters:
char_vec = c("a", "fish", "data is cool")
```

I can show the contents of a vector by typing the name of the vector, or using the `print()` function.

```{r}
# Typing the name of the vector into the console prints the contents
num_vec

# The print() function accomplishes the same task:
print(char_vec)
```


## `data.frame()`

Type your data frame example here.

## `matrix()`

## `length()`


## `nrow()`


## `ncol()`


## `dim()`
